# Neva Project

## Overview
The Neva Project is a Python-based application designed to interact with a VNF (Virtual Network Function) lifecycle management emulator. It provides a command-line interface (CLI) to execute different scenarios related to VNF operations such as scaling, healing, and termination. 

## Features

- **Scenario Execution**: Execute predefined scenarios related to VNF operations.
  - **Scenario 1 (Scale)**: Simulates scaling a VNF instance to handle increased or decreased workload.
  - **Scenario 2 (Heal)**: Simulates healing a VNF instance by recovering from failures or errors.
  - **Scenario 3 (Terminate)**: Simulates terminating a VNF instance.
- **API Key Management**: Automatically retrieve and use an API key for authentication.
- **User-Friendly CLI**: Interactive menu for selecting and executing scenarios.


## NB
- **Emulator Availability:** The emulator sometimes goes down, making it temporarily inaccessible. If you encounter issues, please try again later.
- **Scenario 4:** Scenario 4 is currently not working due to issues with the emulator.
